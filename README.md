# Click-Memory-Game
This memory game tests the users memory by shuffling the 12 pictures after every guess the user makes. If the user clicks on a picture that they have already guessed, the user loses.

The game tracks the users score for each correct guess the user makes, up to a maximum possible score of 12 if the user clicks on every picture without clicking on a picture twice.
